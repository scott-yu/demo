# demo

This project is to demostrate the ability to implement clean and semetic HTML markup. Also, it takes a modular approach to stylesheet(SASS) organization for re-usability and maintainability.

It, however, has miniumm JavaScript functionality which is not the focus of the demo.

Also, it has the tooling support to kick off the development flow with gulp.  

## Installation

You will need to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) to download packages from the NPM repository. Once you have install node, you will be able to install the required packages to run gulp.

Run the following commands after cloning the repo from GitHub.

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`

This default gulp task compiles Sass, starts a watcher for html, css and JavaScript files and also starts a web server for viewing the website.

3. Access the website on `http://localhost:9000`
